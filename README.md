# 📝 To-Do List Application (C + Python GUI)

A desktop **To-Do List application** built using:
- **C** for the backend (data structures + file handling)
- **Python (Tkinter)** for the frontend GUI

This project demonstrates how a low-level C program can power a modern GUI application using inter-process communication and file-based persistence.
